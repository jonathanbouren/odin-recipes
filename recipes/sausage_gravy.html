    <li><strong>What is Sausage Gravy? <br></strong>Biscuits and Sausage gravy is a classic staple breakfast dish in the Midwest and South. It's one dish that I particularly look forward to having on a chilly fall or winter morning.  While we all know that sausage gravy isn't the healthiest dish in the world it is some of the best stick to your ribs comfort food out there!  I highly recommend serving this gravy with my Easy Homemade Drop Biscuits, they are so simple to make!</li>
    <li><strong>How to make sausage gravy?</strong>
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The first step to making this gravy is to cook one pound of pork breakfast sausage.  You can use mild, hot, maple, or any type of pork sausage that you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>Once the sausage is browned through with no pink remaining you will add two tablespoons of butter directly to the cooked sausage and allow it to melt.</li>
      <li>Next, sprinkle your flour over the sausage.  You will stir the flour into the sausage for 1-2 minutes until that "raw flour" smell is gone.  The flour and fat mixture is what will allow your gravy to thicken.</li>
      <li>Pour in the milk slowly while whisking.  Your gravy will continue to thicken and bubble as your pour in the milk.</li>
      <li>Once the milk has all been added to the skillet, you will add your seasonings.  Allow the gravy to simmer for 2-3 minutes until thickened, then serve right away.</li>
      <li>This gravy can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days for best results.</li>
    </ul></li>
